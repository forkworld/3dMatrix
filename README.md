# 3dMatrix

//--------------------------------------------------------------

3dMatrix is a light C++ template library for some type of matrix  
calculation, especially, the field of mesh deformation, 3d 
transformation and so on. 

//--------------------------------------------------------------

3dMatrix uses C++ template to achieve the compile optimizer,
which guarantees it runs fast when the programm needs to 
calculate the new position of thousands of triangles in 3d 
transformation. We must be clearly aware of this point,
because such case is very common in mesh processing and 
some algorithms of compution geometry. 

//--------------------------------------------------------------

3dMatrix is versatile. It supports all matrix sizes,
from small fixed-size matrices to arbitrarily large dense
matrices. 

//--------------------------------------------------------------

The author take much effort to make the API clean
and expressive while feeling natural to C++ programmers, however,
more changes may be taken in the future versiion.

//--------------------------------------------------------------

3dMatrix is written under C++11 standard. The author runs the many
tests against many compilers to guarantee reliability and find the
possible bugs caused by the compiler itself. 

//--------------------------------------------------------------
Using 3dMatrix is very simple and you just include the releated 
the files. 3dMatrix has no other dependent libraries.

//--------------------------------------------------------------
